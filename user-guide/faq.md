### **1.** What is Crest Protocol？ <a href="#1.-what-is-universe-finance" id="1.-what-is-universe-finance"></a>

Crest Protocol is an active liquidity management platform of Uniswap V3 based on risk ranking and quantitative strategies. Our mission is to maximise our users’ Uniswap V3 return. Crest Protocol has provided a series of products and some proactive liquidity management tools to meet challenges such as increased risk, expensive gas fees, the timing and frequency of rebalancing and reinvestment. Crest Protocol strives to be one of the best decentralised DeFi platforms. Welcome aboard our spaceship: https://www.crest.money

### 2. Why did we decide to start Crest Protocol? <a href="#2.-why-did-we-decide-to-start-universe-finance" id="2.-why-did-we-decide-to-start-universe-finance"></a>

We realised the launch of Uniswap V3 offers us a great opportunity. Uniswap V3 boosts LP’s trading fees while increasing the risks of impermanent loss. LPs are focusing on higher yields at lower risks. Our rich experiences in developing quantitative strategies did help us enter this area smoothly to maximise LPs’ returns.

### **3. The main focus of** Crest Protocol <a href="#4.-the-main-focus-of-universe-finance" id="4.-the-main-focus-of-universe-finance"></a>

We are focusing on community growth, and ads in terms of marketing.We are working on leverage vault and hedge vault in terms of development. Stay tuned, and new products are coming soon.

### **4. What’s the difference between** Crest Protocol **and other Uni-V3 LP management programs?** <a href="#6.-whats-the-difference-between-universe-finance-and-other-uni-v3-lp-management-programs" id="6.-whats-the-difference-between-universe-finance-and-other-uni-v3-lp-management-programs"></a>

There are three main differences:

(1) Crest’s yields remain high and stable for a long time.

(2) Crest only charges 5%-10% performance fees (only when our strategies profits). There is no redemption fee, management fee, and other fees.

(3) Crest offers more products to meet different needs. In addition to our LP management vaults, we also have a hedge vault (under development) and leverage vault (under development). And we have already developed a private smart vault for high-net-worth and institutional users. The private vault is a highly secure version of the smart vault, protecting users’ funds through various security mechanisms.Besides, we also have some analytic tools such as our backtesting platform and LP analytics. ​

## Liquidity Mining <a href="#liquidity-mining" id="liquidity-mining"></a>

### 1. Why are we mainly based on V3 instead of V2? What is the difference between Uniswap V3 and V2? <a href="#1.-why-are-we-mainly-based-on-v3-instead-of-v2-what-is-the-difference-between-uniswap-v3-and-v2" id="1.-why-are-we-mainly-based-on-v3-instead-of-v2-what-is-the-difference-between-uniswap-v3-and-v2"></a>

The most significant difference between Uniswap V3 and V2 is the price range of liquidity that users provide. In Uniswap v2, liquidity is distributed evenly along the price curve, with assets reserved for all prices between zero and infinity.By contrast, in Uniswap V3, the trading fees are no longer distributed evenly. Uniswap V3 introduces concentrated liquidity, allowing individual liquidity providers to gather the higher trading fees in a specific price range. At the same time, the multiple fee tires provide users with flexible choices for taking on varying degrees of risk.In other words, on the one hand, users can choose to add liquidity to a specific price range and earn different returns. On the other hand, the tighter the price range is, the more trading fees users can gain; also, the risk can be more significant. When it is out of range, LPs would not be able to receive any fees. At the same time, rebalancing the price range requires an expensive gas fee and LPs have to deal with larger impermanent losses than Uniswap V2. Crest has a brilliant quantitative analysis team as a professional active liquidity management platform. After numerous backtesting tests, we have created strategies for different market conditions to help users manage Uniswap V3 liquidity. Our goal is higher returns and lower risks.**Learn more about Uniswap V3:**[ https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3).

### **2. Can you further explain the ways of harvesting higher yields with lower risks?** <a href="#2.-can-you-further-explain-the-ways-of-harvesting-higher-yields-with-lower-risks" id="2.-can-you-further-explain-the-ways-of-harvesting-higher-yields-with-lower-risks"></a>

#### **(1)** Rebalance intelligently <a href="#1-rebalance-intelligently" id="1-rebalance-intelligently"></a>

We rebalance our vaults intelligently. Uniswap V3’s concentrated liquidity boosted returns while amplifying the risks of impermanent loss. When market price moves outside LP’s specified price range, their liquidity is effectively removed from the pool and unable to earn trading fees. Also, they will suffer from impermanent loss. LPs need to continuously update their price ranges to cover the current market price. That’s called “rebalance”. But LPs will also suffer the loss of net value after the rebalances. In short, the timing and parameters of rebalances are complicated quantitative problems.To find the optimal parameters of rebalances, Crest Protocol built a multi-factors quantitative financial model based on the underlying principles of Uniswap V3. After numerous times of backtesting and optimising tests, we have filtered out the ineffective indicators and signals and eventually come up with a comparatively stable rate of return.

#### (2) Reinvestment & auto-compound <a href="#2-reinvestment-and-auto-compound" id="2-reinvestment-and-auto-compound"></a>

We also help LPs reinvest to maintain high yields. Like yield aggregators, we regularly harvest the gained trading fees and reinvest them to auto compound for our users.

#### (3) Saving gas fees <a href="#3-saving-gas-fees" id="3-saving-gas-fees"></a>

Crest Protocol covers all the gas fees of rebalance and reinvestment. Continuous rebalances and reinvestments will definitely cost users a lot of gas fees. If LPs do it all by themselves, their trading fees may not cover the expensive gas fees.

### 3. Why would I deposit on Crest Protocol instead of directly providing liquidity on Uniswap V3? <a href="#4.-why-would-i-deposit-on-universe-finance-instead-of-directly-providing-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3" id="4.-why-would-i-deposit-on-universe-finance-instead-of-directly-providing-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3"></a>

Reasons to deposit on an active liquidity management platform instead of depositing on Uniswap V3 directly:

1.Uniswap won’t automatically compound your interests; Crest does.

2.Uniswap won’t help you adjust your price range; Crest does (You won’t get any trading fees if your liquidity stays outside the current price range).

3.Uniswap won’t cover your rebalance gas fees; Crest does. (You need to pay expensive gas fees when adjusting your price range. Crest will cover all the gas fees of each movement)

### 4. Why do some vaults have unbelievable APRs? <a href="#5.-why-do-some-vaults-have-unbelievable-aprs" id="5.-why-do-some-vaults-have-unbelievable-aprs"></a>

The secrets of high returns:

1.We specifically choose and launch Uniswap V3 vaults with large transaction volume.

2.Crest active liquidity management can further boost users’ returns

### 5. Does the APR represent the authentic returns? <a href="#6.-does-the-apr-represent-the-authentic-returns" id="6.-does-the-apr-represent-the-authentic-returns"></a>

The vaults’ APRs stand for the returns of trading fees gathered from Uniswap V3 pools. It’s not equal to actual returns because real returns may be affected by impermanent losses. Apart from this, under the extreme market, when the price change dramatically (increase or drop rapidly), the pool probably would be out of range and needs to be rebalanced. It could cause impermanent losses as well. Usually, based on the market signals we capture, we would set a wider price range to a low-trading-volume trading pair to keep the pool in the range. In this case, a wider range can help reduce impermanent losses to some extent.

## **Airdrop** <a href="#airdrop" id="airdrop"></a>

### 1. Is there any Airdrop for Early Users in Crest Protocol? <a href="#1.-is-there-any-airdrop-for-early-users-in-universe-finance" id="1.-is-there-any-airdrop-for-early-users-in-universe-finance"></a>

Yes, there is! We will undoubtedly airdrop those early users and contributors. Additionally, we will also carry out an Incentive Plan for Our Early Users lasting for four weeks. By that time, users can claim the airdrop from us.

## **Smart Quantitative Strategies** <a href="#smart-quantitative-strategies" id="smart-quantitative-strategies"></a>

### Are all strategies available on-chain? Or are they operating privately through the smart contract? <a href="#are-all-strategies-available-on-chain-or-are-they-operating-privately-through-the-smart-contract" id="are-all-strategies-available-on-chain-or-are-they-operating-privately-through-the-smart-contract"></a>

We will create the rebalanced signals out of the chain. If a rebalanced signal appears, we will use the rebalance function of the contract.

## **Safety** <a href="#safety" id="safety"></a>

### As more and more attacks happen to DeFi protocols in the past few years, how does Crest Protocol keep our users’ funding safe? <a href="#as-more-and-more-attacks-happen-to-defi-protocols-in-the-past-few-years-how-does-universe-finance-ke" id="as-more-and-more-attacks-happen-to-defi-protocols-in-the-past-few-years-how-does-universe-finance-ke"></a>

#### **(1) Audited by many blockchain audit firms** <a href="#1-audited-by-many-blockchain-audit-firms" id="1-audited-by-many-blockchain-audit-firms"></a>

Crest Protocol guarantees the security of the contracts through the audit of their security protocols by foremost experts in the blockchain field such as Certik and Peckshield. We will continue to engage with other blockchain audit firms in the future to provide high-level security protection to our users.

#### **(2) Externally Owned Account ("EOA") mechanism** <a href="#2-externally-owned-account-eoa-mechanism" id="2-externally-owned-account-eoa-mechanism"></a>

All addresses in the private vault can only be accessed through EOA and not through the Contract Accounts. Because hackers can only launch lightning attacks through Contract Accounts, the EOA mechanism isolates the Contract Accounts and root out the conduit for lightning attacks.

#### **(3)** Unrenewable smart quantitative strategies <a href="#3-unrenewable-smart-quantitative-strategies" id="3-unrenewable-smart-quantitative-strategies"></a>

Smart quantitative strategies cannot be upgraded, which means Crest Team cannot interfere with users' funds through renewing strategies.

#### (4) Bug Bounty Plan <a href="#4-bug-bounty-plan" id="4-bug-bounty-plan"></a>

We think highly of the security of our protocol. We have carried out a bug bounty plan to reward the users who help improve our security. We have been collecting information regarding these attacks. By analysing them, we are learning how to prevent our protocol from being attacked by the same mechanism, further enhancing the security of Crest V2. Although no one can guarantee 100% safety in the DeFi world, we will always try our best to maintain the highest level of security and keep sharp to prevent attacks.**​**
