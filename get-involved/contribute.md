Crest protocol is building a global, community-owned and decentralized economy so we can introduce stability and transparency back into financial markets and create financial inclusion for all.

Crest protocol exists to support projects that bring value to the Crest economy. The Project is driven by the following values:

* Community-run
* Results-oriented
* Sustainable
* Inclusive

While we believe decentralized structures are best suited for achieving this vision, we realize that some structure is needed to align on common goals, evaluate projects, create accountability and ensure successful execution.&#x20;
