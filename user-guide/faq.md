### 1**. What’s the difference between** Crest Protocol **and other Uni-V3 LP management programs?** <a href="#6.-whats-the-difference-between-universe-finance-and-other-uni-v3-lp-management-programs" id="6.-whats-the-difference-between-universe-finance-and-other-uni-v3-lp-management-programs"></a>

There are three main differences:

(1) Crest’s yields remain high and stable for a long time.

(2) Crest only charges 5%-10% performance fees (only when our strategies profits). There is no redemption fee, management fee, and other fees.

(3) Crest offers more products to meet different needs. In addition to our LP management vaults, we also have a hedge vault (under development) and leverage vault (under development). And we have already developed a private smart vault for high-net-worth and institutional users. The private vault is a highly secure version of the smart vault, protecting users’ funds through various security mechanisms.Besides, we also have some analytic tools such as our backtesting platform and LP analytics. ​

### 2. Why would I deposit on Crest Protocol instead of directly providing liquidity on Uniswap V3? <a href="#4.-why-would-i-deposit-on-universe-finance-instead-of-directly-providing-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3" id="4.-why-would-i-deposit-on-universe-finance-instead-of-directly-providing-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3"></a>

Reasons to deposit on an active liquidity management platform instead of depositing on Uniswap V3 directly:

1.Uniswap won’t automatically compound your interests; Crest does.

2.Uniswap won’t help you adjust your price range; Crest does (You won’t get any trading fees if your liquidity stays outside the current price range).

3.Uniswap won’t cover your rebalance gas fees; Crest does. (You need to pay expensive gas fees when adjusting your price range. Crest will cover all the gas fees of each movement)

### 3. Why do some vaults have unbelievable APRs? <a href="#5.-why-do-some-vaults-have-unbelievable-aprs" id="5.-why-do-some-vaults-have-unbelievable-aprs"></a>

The secrets of high returns:

1.We specifically choose and launch Uniswap V3 vaults with large transaction volume.

2.Crest active liquidity management can further boost users’ returns

### 4. Does the APR represent the authentic returns? <a href="#6.-does-the-apr-represent-the-authentic-returns" id="6.-does-the-apr-represent-the-authentic-returns"></a>

The vaults’ APRs stand for the returns of trading fees gathered from Uniswap V3 pools. It’s not equal to actual returns because real returns may be affected by impermanent losses. Apart from this, under the extreme market, when the price change dramatically (increase or drop rapidly), the pool probably would be out of range and needs to be rebalanced. It could cause impermanent losses as well. Usually, based on the market signals we capture, we would set a wider price range to a low-trading-volume trading pair to keep the pool in the range. In this case, a wider range can help reduce impermanent losses to some extent.**​**
